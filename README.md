# Invoice-CLI Work in Progress

I wanted to learn how to write in Rust. I'm using this project to practice. I don't recommend you use this until this readme is more fleshed out as the project will likely be closer to completion. In the meantime, have a look at the src to view my progress.

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic CLI elements using clap
- [x] Database generation
- [x] Basic CRUD for SQlite using rusqlite
- [ ] More complex logic for generating invoices
- [ ] Figure out how to handle logo images for the company table
- [ ] Generate HTML using Tera(?)
- [ ] Generate PDF from HTML
- [ ] ?

## Maybe Features?
- Automatically send generated pdf to company email and client email
- Check if Invoice has been paid
- Send reminders as due date closes
