# Invoice-CLI Work in Progress

I wanted to learn how to write in Rust. I'm using this project to practice. I don't recommend you use this until this readme is more fleshed out as the project will likely be closer to completion. In the meantime, have a look at the src to view my progress.

## Roadmap
[x] Basic CLI elements using clap
[x] Database generation
[x] Basic CRUD for SQlite using rusqlite
[ ] More complex logic for generating invoices
[ ] Generate HTML using Tera(?)
[ ] Generate PDF from HTML
[ ] ?
